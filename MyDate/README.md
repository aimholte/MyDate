This project was bootstrapped with[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

MyDate was created using the Vue.js framework and other libraries to increase
the functionality of the product.  Below you can find instructions
on how to download and run Vue as well as the rest of the libraries.

##Installing VUE.js
To install Vue.js first open Intellij or some other 
command line terminal.  If using Intellij, WebStorm,
or other similar software open the terminal within
the program.  In this terminal install vue by typing
*$ npm install -g vue-cli* into your terminal.
Then type *$ vue init webpack softwaredev* , this creates
a project called softwaredev.  As it installs VUE
will ask you to specify a few things.  The author and
project descrition are irrelevant but it will prompt you
for yes or no questions, answer no to all of them or 
you might perish.  Go to your app directory by
typing *cd softwaredev*.  Then install other 
dependencies by typing *npm install*.  Then go
to GitHub and find our MyDate project and fork the project 
into your created VUE project.

##Installing other dependencies
Besides vue.js other dependencies were used in our code.
Described below are all of these dependencies
and how to install them as well as their use
in our code.<br/>
**Axios**<br/>
First to install axios type:
*npm install --save axios vue-axios*.  In this 
project Axios is used to handle API requests.<br/>
**Firebase**
First to install Firebase type:<br/>
*$ npm init* <br/>
and then:<br/>
*$ npm install --save firebase*
This is not used in the current version of our code
it was scrapped part of the way into development.
<br/>
**Vue Checkbox**<br/>
Into your terminal type:<br/>
*npm install vue-checkbox-radio --save*
<br/>
This dependecy allows for easily formatting and handeling
of checkboxes and their associated variables.
<br/>**Vue Router**<br/>
To install Vue-router type:<br/>
*npm install vue-router*
<br/>
This is used to move between our components in our app
